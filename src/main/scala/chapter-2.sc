// Aside from some technicalities, every value in Scala is whatâ€™s called an object,
// and each object may have zero or more members.

// An object whose primary purpose is giving its members a namespace
// is sometimes called a module.

// A member can be a method declared with the def keyword,
// or it can be another object declared with val or object.
